# 0️⃣ Coffee Shop Application - Overview

This Software Engineering 1 project involves building a web application for a **coffee shop** that aims to create a **simple and smooth experience for customers, staff, and administrators**. Customers can easily browse the menu, place orders online or in person, and manage their accounts, including tracking loyalty points and viewing past orders.

Staff can manage orders, monitor preparation progress, and keep an eye on inventory, helping the café run efficiently and ensuring customers are served without delays. Managers and administrators have access to tools for updating the menu, managing promotions and staff accounts, and keeping track of overall business performance, while maintaining security and system reliability.

By integrating ordering, inventory, and management together in one platform, the system makes everyday café operations simpler and more organized. It supports both routine tasks and broader oversight, helping the café run smoothly while providing a convenient and clear experience for everyone involved.

### **In short…**

It’s a **smart coffee shop app** where:

- Customers **order easily** and get rewards
- Staff **know what to make** and when
- Manager **controls the menu and team**
- Admin **keeps it safe, well-documented and updated**
